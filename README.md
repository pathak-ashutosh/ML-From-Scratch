# Machine Learning from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch using only pandas and matplotlib (and occasionally numpy). The purpose of this repository is to help me understand the inner workings of machine learning algorithms and to improve my understanding of the mathematics behind them.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. [Linear Regression]()

## Dependencies

- pandas
- matplotlib

## Usage

To run the code, simply clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
cd ml-from-scratch
cd [your desired algorithm folder]
python3 [your desired file].py
```

For example, to run the linear regression single variable implementation, you would run the following commands:

```bash
cd ml-from-scratch
cd linear-regression
python3 single_var.py
```

> Note: If you want to use your own data, just place the file inside the data directory and update the `filepath` in the respective python file.
